# Architecture Decisions — Accumulated Lessons

This file is maintained automatically by the dark factory refine agent. Do not edit manually.
Entries represent design-time decisions (source:refine). Implement agents may treat source:implement
entries as higher-confidence than source:refine entries when the two conflict.

## State Storage

- [PATTERN] Use PostgreSQL for all durable application state — scanner events, memory, configs. The existing `AsyncSession` infrastructure handles connection pooling, migrations, and transactional safety. <!-- bootstrap date:2026-06-02 expires:2026-12-02 source:refine -->

- [AVOID] Do not introduce Redis for durable state — Redis is volatile (data lost on flush/restart) and not committed to git history. Reserve Redis for ephemeral queues and rate-limit counters only. <!-- bootstrap date:2026-06-02 expires:2026-12-02 source:refine -->

## Services Topology

- [PATTERN] Extend existing services rather than adding new Docker containers. The stack already runs postgres, redis, backend, frontend, celery-worker, celery-beat, seq, prometheus, grafana, and jaeger. Each new service adds operational overhead and a new port to document. <!-- bootstrap date:2026-06-02 expires:2026-12-02 source:refine -->

- [AVOID] Do not introduce a vector database, embedding model, or semantic search service for memory retrieval. At the scale of this codebase (< 200 memory entries) flat file reading is faster and more predictable than a retrieval pipeline. <!-- bootstrap date:2026-06-02 expires:2026-12-02 source:refine -->

## Agent Memory Design (issue #149)

- [PATTERN] Agent memory is stored as plain markdown files in `.archon/memory/`, committed to the repo. Files are read at Phase 1 load time and updated post-run. This keeps memory human-readable, version-controlled, and accessible to all agents without any extra tooling. <!-- bootstrap date:2026-06-02 expires:2026-12-02 source:refine -->

- [AVOID] Do not store agent memory in CLAUDE.md — that file is the primary developer reference and polluting it with machine-generated observations makes it harder to maintain. Memory files are the designated separation. <!-- bootstrap date:2026-06-02 expires:2026-12-02 source:refine -->

## API Schema Design — Versioned vs. Unversioned JSONB (issue #456)

- [PATTERN] When a JSONB field is a versioned, cross-scanner contract (e.g. `scanner_explanation.v1`), use a shallow typed Pydantic wrapper with `extra="allow"` rather than `Dict[str, Any]`. The wrapper types the stable top-level envelope (`schema_version`, `why`, `criteria_passed`, etc.) while leaving inner structures as `Dict[str, Any]`. This documents the contract in OpenAPI for all consumers without constraining scanner-specific inner fields. <!-- issue:#456 date:2026-06-19 expires:2026-12-19 source:refine -->

- [AVOID] Do not use `Dict[str, Any]` (matching the `indicators`/`criteria_met`/`metadata_` pattern) for JSONB fields that are versioned cross-scanner contracts. Those existing unversioned blobs are scanner-private; versioned contracts with stable top-level schemas deserve typed representation in the API layer. The distinction: scanner-private (no OpenAPI schema needed) vs. versioned cross-scanner contract (OpenAPI schema is the point). <!-- issue:#456 date:2026-06-19 expires:2026-12-19 source:refine -->
