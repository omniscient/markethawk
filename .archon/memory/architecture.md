# Architecture Decisions — Accumulated Lessons

This file is maintained automatically by the dark factory refine agent. Do not edit manually.
Entries represent design-time decisions (source:refine). Implement agents may treat source:implement
entries as higher-confidence than source:refine entries when the two conflict.

## State Storage

- [PATTERN] Use PostgreSQL for all durable application state — scanner events, memory, configs. The existing `AsyncSession` infrastructure handles connection pooling, migrations, and transactional safety. <!-- bootstrap date:2026-06-02 expires:2026-12-02 source:refine -->

- [AVOID] Do not introduce Redis for durable state — Redis is volatile (data lost on flush/restart) and not committed to git history. Reserve Redis for ephemeral queues and rate-limit counters only. <!-- bootstrap date:2026-06-02 expires:2026-12-02 source:refine -->

## Services Topology

- [PATTERN] Extend existing services rather than adding new Docker containers. The stack already runs postgres, redis, backend, frontend, celery-worker, celery-beat, seq, prometheus, grafana, and jaeger. Each new service adds operational overhead and a new port to document. <!-- bootstrap date:2026-06-02 expires:2026-12-02 source:refine -->

- [AVOID] Do not introduce a vector database, embedding model, or semantic search service for memory retrieval. At the scale of this codebase (< 200 memory entries) flat file reading is faster and more predictable than a retrieval pipeline. <!-- bootstrap date:2026-06-02 expires:2026-12-02 source:refine -->

## Agent Memory Design (issue #149)

- [PATTERN] Agent memory is stored as plain markdown files in `.archon/memory/`, committed to the repo. Files are read at Phase 1 load time and updated post-run. This keeps memory human-readable, version-controlled, and accessible to all agents without any extra tooling. <!-- bootstrap date:2026-06-02 expires:2026-12-02 source:refine -->

- [AVOID] Do not store agent memory in CLAUDE.md — that file is the primary developer reference and polluting it with machine-generated observations makes it harder to maintain. Memory files are the designated separation. <!-- bootstrap date:2026-06-02 expires:2026-12-02 source:refine -->

- [AVOID] Route every new Polygon reference-endpoint call (dividends, splits, etc.) through MassiveDataProvider + POLYGON_BREAKER, not a raw unbreakered httpx call. sync_stock_splits (backend/app/tasks/sync.py) is an older exception that calls https://api.polygon.io/v3/reference/splits directly with httpx, bypassing DataProviderFactory and POLYGON_BREAKER entirely — do not copy it. MassiveDataProvider.get_ticker_details() already proves reference-endpoint calls go through POLYGON_BREAKER.call(...) in this provider, so a new breaker-wrapped method on MassiveDataProvider (e.g. get_dividends()) is the pattern to extend; a raw call would keep hitting Polygon while the breaker is open and would be invisible to app/core/provider_health.py. <!-- issue:#912 date:2026-11-06 expires:2027-05-06 source:refine agent:refine scope:architecture path:backend/app/providers/ -->
