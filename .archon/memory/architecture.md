# Architecture Decisions — Accumulated Lessons

This file is maintained automatically by the dark factory refine agent. Do not edit manually.
Entries represent design-time decisions (source:refine). Implement agents may treat source:implement
entries as higher-confidence than source:refine entries when the two conflict.

## State Storage

- [PATTERN] Use PostgreSQL for all durable application state — scanner events, memory, configs. The existing `AsyncSession` infrastructure handles connection pooling, migrations, and transactional safety. <!-- bootstrap date:2026-06-02 expires:2026-12-02 source:refine -->

- [AVOID] Do not introduce Redis for durable state — Redis is volatile (data lost on flush/restart) and not committed to git history. Reserve Redis for ephemeral queues and rate-limit counters only. <!-- bootstrap date:2026-06-02 expires:2026-12-02 source:refine -->

## Services Topology

- [PATTERN] Extend existing services rather than adding new Docker containers. The stack already runs postgres, redis, backend, frontend, celery-worker, celery-beat, seq, prometheus, grafana, and jaeger. Each new service adds operational overhead and a new port to document. <!-- bootstrap date:2026-06-02 expires:2026-12-02 source:refine -->

- [AVOID] Do not introduce a vector database, embedding model, or semantic search service for memory retrieval. At the scale of this codebase (< 200 memory entries) flat file reading is faster and more predictable than a retrieval pipeline. <!-- bootstrap date:2026-06-02 expires:2026-12-02 source:refine -->

## Agent Memory Design (issue #149)

- [PATTERN] Agent memory is stored as plain markdown files in `.archon/memory/`, committed to the repo. Files are read at Phase 1 load time and updated post-run. This keeps memory human-readable, version-controlled, and accessible to all agents without any extra tooling. <!-- bootstrap date:2026-06-02 expires:2026-12-02 source:refine -->

- [AVOID] Do not store agent memory in CLAUDE.md — that file is the primary developer reference and polluting it with machine-generated observations makes it harder to maintain. Memory files are the designated separation. <!-- bootstrap date:2026-06-02 expires:2026-12-02 source:refine -->

## CI Security Scanning

- [PATTERN] Use two Trivy steps per matrix image: one `format: table` step with `exit-code: "1"`, `severity: HIGH,CRITICAL`, and `ignore-unfixed: true` to gate the job; one `format: sarif` step with `exit-code: "0"` and `if: always()` to feed the GitHub Security tab. A single step with `format: sarif` + `exit-code: "1"` does not reliably block in `aquasecurity/trivy-action@0.28.0` — the SARIF formatter and exit-code gate are separate code paths. <!-- issue:#293 date:2026-06-13 expires:2026-12-13 source:refine -->

- [AVOID] Do not set `continue-on-error: true` on the `scan` job — it swallows step failures and makes the Trivy gate appear to pass even when the table step exits 1. Remove it (or set it to `false`) whenever Trivy is intended to block the publish. <!-- issue:#293 date:2026-06-13 expires:2026-12-13 source:refine -->

     Each will be promoted to [PATTERN] on second-run confirmation (different issue number) or dropped at TTL. -->
