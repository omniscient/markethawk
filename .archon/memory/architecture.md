# Architecture Decisions — Accumulated Lessons

This file is maintained automatically by the dark factory refine agent. Do not edit manually.
Entries represent design-time decisions (source:refine). Implement agents may treat source:implement
entries as higher-confidence than source:refine entries when the two conflict.

## State Storage

- [PATTERN] Use PostgreSQL for all durable application state — scanner events, memory, configs. The existing `AsyncSession` infrastructure handles connection pooling, migrations, and transactional safety. <!-- bootstrap date:2026-06-02 expires:2026-12-02 source:refine -->

- [AVOID] Do not introduce Redis for durable state — Redis is volatile (data lost on flush/restart) and not committed to git history. Reserve Redis for ephemeral queues and rate-limit counters only. <!-- bootstrap date:2026-06-02 expires:2026-12-02 source:refine -->

## Services Topology

- [PATTERN] Extend existing services rather than adding new Docker containers. The stack already runs postgres, redis, backend, frontend, celery-worker, celery-beat, seq, prometheus, grafana, and jaeger. Each new service adds operational overhead and a new port to document. <!-- bootstrap date:2026-06-02 expires:2026-12-02 source:refine -->

- [AVOID] Do not introduce a vector database, embedding model, or semantic search service for memory retrieval. At the scale of this codebase (< 200 memory entries) flat file reading is faster and more predictable than a retrieval pipeline. <!-- bootstrap date:2026-06-02 expires:2026-12-02 source:refine -->

## Agent Memory Design (issue #149)

- [PATTERN] Agent memory is stored as plain markdown files in `.archon/memory/`, committed to the repo. Files are read at Phase 1 load time and updated post-run. This keeps memory human-readable, version-controlled, and accessible to all agents without any extra tooling. <!-- bootstrap date:2026-06-02 expires:2026-12-02 source:refine -->

- [AVOID] Do not store agent memory in CLAUDE.md — that file is the primary developer reference and polluting it with machine-generated observations makes it harder to maintain. Memory files are the designated separation. <!-- bootstrap date:2026-06-02 expires:2026-12-02 source:refine -->

- [AVOID] [AVOID] Do not introduce category subdirectories (e.g. phase/ or reference/) between .claude/skills/ and skill folders — Claude Code's skill loader discovers skills by scanning for SKILL.md files in the immediate child of .claude/skills/; nesting a category directory there breaks discovery. Encode the phase-vs-reference distinction in frontmatter (disable-model-invocation, user-invocable) instead. <!-- issue:#693 date:2026-07-01 expires:2027-01-01 source:refine agent:refine scope:architecture path:.claude/skills/ -->
- [AVOID] [AVOID] Do not promote factory subagent persona files (product-owner-prompt.md, architect-prompt.md) to standalone skills with their own invocable frontmatter — promotion adds new description-match surfaces for auto-triggering and expands the review footprint. These files are variable-substituted prompt templates; they live in the parent skill's templates/ directory and are never independently invocable. <!-- issue:#693 date:2026-07-01 expires:2027-01-01 source:refine agent:refine scope:architecture path:.claude/skills/ -->

<!-- PROVISIONAL — entries below are from a single observed run; unverified.
     Do not rely on these as authoritative guidance. They are excluded from
     plan/implement prompt injection except as advisory context.
     Each will be promoted to [PATTERN] on second-run confirmation (different issue number) or dropped at TTL. -->
