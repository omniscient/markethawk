# Architecture Decisions — Accumulated Lessons

This file is maintained automatically by the dark factory refine agent. Do not edit manually.
Entries represent design-time decisions (source:refine). Implement agents may treat source:implement
entries as higher-confidence than source:refine entries when the two conflict.

## State Storage

- [PATTERN] Use PostgreSQL for all durable application state — scanner events, memory, configs. The existing `AsyncSession` infrastructure handles connection pooling, migrations, and transactional safety. <!-- bootstrap date:2026-06-02 expires:2026-12-02 source:refine -->

- [AVOID] Do not introduce Redis for durable state — Redis is volatile (data lost on flush/restart) and not committed to git history. Reserve Redis for ephemeral queues and rate-limit counters only. <!-- bootstrap date:2026-06-02 expires:2026-12-02 source:refine -->

## Services Topology

- [PATTERN] Extend existing services rather than adding new Docker containers. The stack already runs postgres, redis, backend, frontend, celery-worker, celery-beat, seq, prometheus, grafana, and jaeger. Each new service adds operational overhead and a new port to document. <!-- bootstrap date:2026-06-02 expires:2026-12-02 source:refine -->

- [AVOID] Do not introduce a vector database, embedding model, or semantic search service for memory retrieval. At the scale of this codebase (< 200 memory entries) flat file reading is faster and more predictable than a retrieval pipeline. <!-- bootstrap date:2026-06-02 expires:2026-12-02 source:refine -->

## Agent Memory Design (issue #149)

- [PATTERN] Agent memory is stored as plain markdown files in `.archon/memory/`, committed to the repo. Files are read at Phase 1 load time and updated post-run. This keeps memory human-readable, version-controlled, and accessible to all agents without any extra tooling. <!-- bootstrap date:2026-06-02 expires:2026-12-02 source:refine -->

- [AVOID] Do not store agent memory in CLAUDE.md — that file is the primary developer reference and polluting it with machine-generated observations makes it harder to maintain. Memory files are the designated separation. <!-- bootstrap date:2026-06-02 expires:2026-12-02 source:refine -->

## WebSocket Resource Guards

- [PATTERN] Per-user WebSocket connection caps are implemented as an in-process `defaultdict(int)` counter in a dedicated `app/core/ws_limits.py` module, NOT via Redis — the backend runs as a single process, making in-memory counters correct and cheaper than Redis round-trips per handshake. If the stack ever scales to multiple replicas, migrate to Redis `INCR`/`DECR` with atomic compare. <!-- issue:#377 date:2026-06-13 expires:2026-12-13 source:refine -->

- [AVOID] Do not implement WebSocket guards (connection caps, Origin validation, timeout logic) in ASGI middleware — all existing middlewares (`AuthMiddleware`, `CSRFMiddleware`, `PrometheusMiddleware`) explicitly skip `scope["type"] == "websocket"`. WS guards must be FastAPI dependencies (following the `ws_get_current_user` pattern in `app/core/auth.py`) so they run before `websocket.accept()`. <!-- issue:#377 date:2026-06-13 expires:2026-12-13 source:refine -->

     Each will be promoted to [PATTERN] on second-run confirmation (different issue number) or dropped at TTL. -->
