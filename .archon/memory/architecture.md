# Architecture Decisions — Accumulated Lessons

This file is maintained automatically by the dark factory refine agent. Do not edit manually.
Entries represent design-time decisions (source:refine). Implement agents may treat source:implement
entries as higher-confidence than source:refine entries when the two conflict.

## State Storage

- [PATTERN] Use PostgreSQL for all durable application state — scanner events, memory, configs. The existing `AsyncSession` infrastructure handles connection pooling, migrations, and transactional safety. <!-- bootstrap date:2026-06-02 expires:2026-12-02 source:refine -->

- [AVOID] Do not introduce Redis for durable state — Redis is volatile (data lost on flush/restart) and not committed to git history. Reserve Redis for ephemeral queues and rate-limit counters only. <!-- bootstrap date:2026-06-02 expires:2026-12-02 source:refine -->

## Services Topology

- [PATTERN] Extend existing services rather than adding new Docker containers. The stack already runs postgres, redis, backend, frontend, celery-worker, celery-beat, seq, prometheus, grafana, and jaeger. Each new service adds operational overhead and a new port to document. <!-- bootstrap date:2026-06-02 expires:2026-12-02 source:refine -->

- [AVOID] Do not introduce a vector database, embedding model, or semantic search service for memory retrieval. At the scale of this codebase (< 200 memory entries) flat file reading is faster and more predictable than a retrieval pipeline. <!-- bootstrap date:2026-06-02 expires:2026-12-02 source:refine -->

## Agent Memory Design (issue #149)

- [PATTERN] Agent memory is stored as plain markdown files in `.archon/memory/`, committed to the repo. Files are read at Phase 1 load time and updated post-run. This keeps memory human-readable, version-controlled, and accessible to all agents without any extra tooling. <!-- bootstrap date:2026-06-02 expires:2026-12-02 source:refine -->

- [AVOID] Do not store agent memory in CLAUDE.md — that file is the primary developer reference and polluting it with machine-generated observations makes it harder to maintain. Memory files are the designated separation. <!-- bootstrap date:2026-06-02 expires:2026-12-02 source:refine -->

## LLM Feature Integration (issue #480)

- [PATTERN] When building an LLM feature that depends on upstream artifacts (briefs, embeddings, provenance enforcement) that are not yet implemented: define the target contract schema first (e.g. `ai_signal_brief.v1`), populate available fields from existing data, and declare unavailable slots explicitly as UNAVAILABLE in the LLM system prompt. This prevents hallucination of missing context and keeps the contract stable when real artifacts arrive — the builder becomes a thin pass-through and the field-mapping path is retired. See `analyst_qa.build_brief()` in issue #480. <!-- issue:#480 date:2026-06-19 expires:2026-12-19 source:refine -->

- [AVOID] Do not block an LLM feature on all upstream artifact blockers being complete before writing any code. Define the grounding contract (schema + UNAVAILABLE declarations) and build against it now. The grounding system prompt already handles missing slots safely, so partial data is better than indefinite delay. <!-- issue:#480 date:2026-06-19 expires:2026-12-19 source:refine -->

     Each will be promoted to [PATTERN] on second-run confirmation (different issue number) or dropped at TTL. -->
